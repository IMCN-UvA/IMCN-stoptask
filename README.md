# IMCN-stoptask
Stop signal task implemented in PsychoPy

Code makes use of the [exptools](https://github.com/VU-Cog-Sci/exptools) package developed at [the Knapen lab](https://github.com/VU-Cog-Sci) at the VU Amsterdam



NB: Due to technical issues with the presentation computer, this version of the Stop Task was *not* used at the scanner (we reverted to a version implemented in Presentation). Some minor piloting was performed but use with caution.
